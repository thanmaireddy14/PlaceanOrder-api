# PlaceanOrder-api

2 API's are created for this Assignment.
One API is for adding customers to Database and the other is for placing an order.
I have used Inmemory Database H2 of springboot to store details of customer.
We have 2 tables, one table us for customer details and the other is for Products and Warehouses details.

URL's:
Add a Customer:http://localhost:8080/api/customer
Place a Order:http://localhost:8080/api/order

Both API's are POST Mapping.
